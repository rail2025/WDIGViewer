add your own files, link to the folder with the images in the format of <br>
C:\YOUR_CHOSEN_DIRECTORY\PluginImages\FIGHT_OR_STRAT_NAME\PHASE\IMAGE_FILE. <br>
for example if you have some files like <br>
C:\YOUR_CHOSEN_DIRECTORY\PluginImages\UCOB\P1\GarudaBaits.jpg, C:\YOUR_CHOSEN_DIRECTORY\PluginImages\UCOB\P2\IfritDash.jpg, <br>
you would point the directory to C:\YOUR_CHOSEN_DIRECTORY\PluginImages\ <br>
store in PluginImages, rename the fight to whatever you want. shows in alphanumerical file name order, so rename image files accordingly.<br>
WTFDIGViewer will also attempt to auto load baseed on the zone/duty you are in and the folder name, so if you use the official name of the duty/area, or at least as close as possible, it will load the folder correctly.

<br>IMPORTANT!!
<br>
reload after addiing images with /wdig reload, hit the rescan button <br>
